Our final year project.

In this project, we analysed 1000 English songs. If a sequence of tones from lyrics is frequently matched with a specific melody of song, we called this a pattern. For every song, we collected a set of all frequent patterns. Then we found a final set of all frequent patterns over all songs. Our program can analyse any English sentences as input, and generate a melody according to the final set of frequent patterns.
